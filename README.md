# contextum

Contextum is a text crawler for finding the phrases in which words appear.
I decided to write this program when I was reading an english book to improve
my vocabulary. Every time I found a new or a difficult word, I noted down on a
piece of paper the phrase in which the word appeared in order to remember how it
was used in its context. Since this was a tedious and time consuming task, I
thought it would be interesting to try to automate it using a computer program.
